"""
Data processing and loading modules for DeepSeek-V3 training.

This package provides utilities for:
- Loading and mixing data from Allen AI's Dolma dataset
- Data preprocessing and sanitization pipeline
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Deduplication (MinHash and exact)
- Quality filtering
- Domain mixing and composition
